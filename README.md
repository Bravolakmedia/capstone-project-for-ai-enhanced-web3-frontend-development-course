Welcome to the Capstone Project for the AI-Enhanced Web3 Frontend Development Course at dProgramming University. 

This is frontend project for creating a token minting dApp. The project was done and submitted for approval by :
Olukosi Ismaila Bamidele.

## MY EXPERIENCE:

### SECTION 1 - HTML:

1. I learnt about HTML element tags and how to use them.
2. I learnt about how to implement AI to enhance website design and dApp interphase.
3. I also learnt how to implement HTML5 best practices.
4. My Challenge: I have no challenges in the course as I followed the course and use AI assistance.

## MY EXPERIENCE:

### SECTION 2 - CSS:

1. I learnt about CSS styling like inline, external, text and font styling.
2. I learnt about CSS syntax, selectors, combinators and variables.
3. I learnt about how to use CSS flex box for responsive designs.
4. I learnt about how to use AI in implementing CSS styling of website and dApps.
5. I learnt about CSS libraries/frameworks like Boostrap and Tailwind.
6. Challenges: I used chatGPT to create my stylesheet for the Token Minter dApp and discovered that despite the footer section text having white color, one text in the section is coloured purple. 
 Another challenge is the implementation of changing one text in the footer section to change from purple to pink when displaying Token Minter dApp on Android phones. 
 Both challenges were resolved by prompting with ChatGPT.
